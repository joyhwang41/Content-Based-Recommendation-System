# Content-Based-Recommendation-System
The goal for this project is to build a content-based recommender system for music and podcasts by calling NYTimes, Penguin, and Spotify APIs to collect user engagement data and utilize NLP and Machine Learning techniques to provide personalized recommendations.

By applying Word2Vec vectorization to the textual data, similarities between articles and songs/podcasts of similar flavor are calculated. This approach enables the system to make personalized recommendations based on user engagement history and the similarity of their interests.
